Steps to Test Using Testfully
Create a New Test:
Log in to your Testfully account.
Create a new test and name it appropriately (e.g., "User Registration Test").
Add Request for Registration:
Add a new request to the test.
Set the method to POST.
Enter the URL for the registration endpoint.
Set the headers to Content-Type: application/json.
Add the JSON body for the registration request.
Add Request for Login:
Add another request to the same test.
Set the method to POST.
Enter the URL for the login endpoint.
Set the headers to Content-Type: application/json.
Add the JSON body for the login request.
Run the Test:
Save the test and run it.
Check the responses to ensure that the registration and login endpoints are working correctly.
By following these steps, you can test your API endpoints using Testfully or any other external API testing platform.
